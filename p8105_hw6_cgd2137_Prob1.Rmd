NYC Restaurant Inspection Data set possible questions/analyses:

* Does restaurant grade distribution vary across boroughs? 

* Do restaurant types vary across boroughs? 

* How do restaurant grade/inspections vary across types of restaurants? 

* What types of violations are most/least common? (how does this vary across grades?)

Your dashboard should include at least three distinct plot types (e.g. scatterplots, line plots, bar plots, box plots, etc.).

Column {data-width=650}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chart A

```{r}
# put plotly code in these code chunks to specify the dashboard orientation/plots

nyc_restaurant_inspections %>% 
  filter(grade %in% c("A", "B", "C")) %>% 
  select(cuisine_description, grade) %>%
  group_by(cuisine_description) %>%
  count(grade) %>%
  spread(key = grade, value = n) %>%
  mutate(total = rowSums(cbind(A, B, C), na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(total >= 3000) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~cuisine_description, y = ~A, type = 'bar', name = 'A') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~B, name = 'B') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~C, name = 'C') %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title = 'Count'), barmode = 'stack') %>% 
  layout(margin = list(b = 75), xaxis = list(title = "", tickangle = 45)) # `margin` adjusts the space for the x-axis labels


#How can we improve the axis labels?--hard to read 
```

Column {data-width=350}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chart B

```{r}
 nyc_restaurant_inspections %>%
  filter(boro != "Missing") %>%
  group_by(zipcode) %>%
  mutate(num_restaurants_zip = n()) %>%
  mutate(text_label = stringr::str_c("Zipcode:", zipcode, " Num_restaurants:", num_restaurants_zip)) %>%
  plot_ly(y = ~num_restaurants_zip, color = ~boro, type = "box")
  
manhattan_zip<- nyc_restaurant_inspections %>%
  filter(boro == "MANHATTAN") %>%
  mutate(zipcode=as.character(zipcode)) %>%
  group_by(zipcode) %>%
  mutate(num_restaurants_man = n()) %>%
  mutate(text_label = stringr::str_c("Zipcode:",zipcode, " Num_restaurants:", num_restaurants_man)) %>%
  plot_ly(x= ~zipcode, y = ~num_restaurants_man,color= ~boro, type = "scatter", mode = "marker", text = ~text_label) %>% 
  layout(margin = list(b = 75))
```


For use in Shiny:
```{r} 
 brooklyn_zip<- nyc_restaurant_inspections %>%
  filter(boro == "BROOKLYN") %>%
  mutate(zipcode=as.character(zipcode)) %>%
  group_by(zipcode) %>%
  mutate(num_restaurants_zip = n()) %>%
  mutate(text_label = stringr::str_c("Zipcode:",zipcode, " Num_restaurants:", num_restaurants_zip)) %>%
  plot_ly(x= ~zipcode, y = ~num_restaurants_zip,color= ~boro, type = "scatter", mode = "marker", text = ~text_label)) 
 
 queens_zip<- nyc_restaurant_inspections %>%
  filter(boro == "QUEENS") %>%
  mutate(zipcode=as.character(zipcode)) %>%
  group_by(zipcode) %>%
  mutate(num_restaurants_zip = n()) %>%
  mutate(text_label = stringr::str_c("Zipcode:",zipcode, " Num_restaurants:", num_restaurants_zip)) %>%
  plot_ly(x= ~zipcode, y = ~num_restaurants_zip,color= ~boro, type = "scatter", mode = "marker", text = ~text_label))
 
 bronx_zip<- nyc_restaurant_inspections %>%
  filter(boro == "BRONX") %>%
  mutate(zipcode=as.character(zipcode)) %>%
  group_by(zipcode) %>%
  mutate(num_restaurants_zip = n()) %>%
  mutate(text_label = stringr::str_c("Zipcode:",zipcode, " Num_restaurants:", num_restaurants_zip)) %>%
  plot_ly(x= ~zipcode, y = ~num_restaurants_zip,color= ~boro, type = "scatter", mode = "marker", text = ~text_label))
 
 staten_zip<- nyc_restaurant_inspections %>%
  filter(boro == "STATEN ISLAND") %>%
  mutate(zipcode=as.character(zipcode)) %>%
  group_by(zipcode) %>%
  mutate(num_restaurants_zip = n()) %>%
  mutate(text_label = stringr::str_c("Zipcode:",zipcode, " Num_restaurants:", num_restaurants_zip)) %>%
  plot_ly(x= ~zipcode, y = ~num_restaurants_zip,color= ~boro, type = "scatter", mode = "marker", text = ~text_label))
 
 subplot(manhattan_zip, brooklyn_zip, queens_zip, bronx_zip, staten_zip)
```

### Chart C

Distribution of scores within A-graded restaurants per boro/zip/whatever

```{r}

```
